## 🔐 How to Set Admin Role

```sql
-- Update existing user to admin
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'ADMIN' 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Or use user ID
UPDATE users 
SET role = 'ADMIN' 
WHERE u_id = 15;
```

### Method 2: Use Existing Admin User

Also test user with ADMIN role:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't see admin menu items
**Solution**: Check user role in database
```sql
SELECT u_id, name, email, role FROM users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```
Should show `role = 'ADMIN'`

### Issue: 404 on admin routes
**Solution**: Check Route.jsx has imports and routes added
```jsx
import AdminPayments from '../pages/dashboard/AdminPayments';
import AdminApplications from '../pages/dashboard/AdminApplications';
```

### Issue: Empty tables
**Solution**: Check backend is running
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/payments
curl http://localhost:8080/api/adoption-applications
```

### Issue: Status update not working
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Verify backend logs:
```bash
tail -f backend/backend.log
```
